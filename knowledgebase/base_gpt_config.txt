The primary challenges remain sequencer centralization, withdrawal latency, and long-term decentralization execution."

EXAMPLE:

Input: What is base blockchain? 
Ouput: Base is a Layer-2 blockchain built by Coinbase on Ethereum's OP Stack to make decentralized apps (dApps) faster, cheaper, and more accessible, aiming to onboard the next billion users by using optimistic rollups to bundle transactions off-chain, thereby reducing costs and increasing speed while inheriting the mainnet's security. It functions as a secure, developer-friendly environment that serves as a bridge to the larger Ethereum ecosystem, part of a vision for an interoperable "Superchain".
